### Backend Setup with Hasura and PostgreSQL

1. **Database Configuration**:

   - Set up a PostgreSQL database to store data about users, links, and profiles.
   - Use tables for storing user information (including profile details like first name, last name, profile picture, and email), and link information (including URL, platform type, and user association).

2. **Hasura GraphQL Engine**:
   - Connect Hasura to the PostgreSQL database to automatically generate a GraphQL API.
   - Configure real-time subscriptions to allow frontend applications to react to database changes instantly.
   - Set up event triggers in Hasura for actions like inserting, updating, or deleting links, which can execute custom logic or integrate with external systems.
   - Implement fine-grained access control using Hasura’s permission system to secure data access based on user roles.

### Frontend Development with React and Apollo Client

1. **React Application**:

   - Use React for building the UI, focusing on components for link management, profile details, and previews.
   - Employ responsive design practices to ensure the app is optimized for different device screen sizes.
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality for reordering links using React libraries like `react-beautiful-dnd`.

2. **Apollo Client Integration**:
   - Set up Apollo Client to connect the React frontend with the Hasura GraphQL backend.
   - Use Apollo's `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks for fetching data and performing operations like create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) on links and profile details.
   - Leverage Apollo Client’s caching mechanism to reduce network requests and improve user experience by instant UI updates.

### Features Implementation

- **CRUD Operations for Links and Profile**:

  - Allow users to add, read, update, and delete links.
  - Validate link submissions to ensure they match the expected URL pattern for the specified platform.
  - Enable users to add and update profile details. Ensure first and last names are mandatory.

- **Real-Time Preview and Interactivity**:

  - Implement a mobile mockup preview that updates in real-time as users add or modify links.
  - Use GraphQL subscriptions to update the UI in real-time as users or other processes modify the link data.

- **User Authentication and Security**:

  - Integrate user authentication to manage user sessions. Allow operations to be performed only by authenticated users.
  - Use Hasura's role-based access control to manage what data each user can access or modify.

- **Advanced Features**:
  - Implement drag-and-drop functionality for reordering links.
  - Add a feature to copy the user’s link-sharing profile URL to the clipboard.
  - Optional: Integrate image uploading functionality for profile pictures using a service like Cloudinary.
  - User log-out, User delete account
  - landing page
