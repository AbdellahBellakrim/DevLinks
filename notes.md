### Backend: Hasura

**Hasura** is an open-source engine that connects to databases & microservices, providing a production-ready GraphQL API instantly. Here’s what makes Hasura stand out:

- **Instant Realtime GraphQL API**: It auto-generates a GraphQL API from a database schema, offering a functional API by simply connecting it to a Postgres database.
- **Event Triggers**: Setting up triggers on database events like insert, update, and delete enables running server-side logic.
- **Fine-grained Access Control**: Its robust permission system can handle complex access patterns directly in the database.

#### Deployment Options

- **Hasura Cloud**: A managed service that ensures scalability, reliability, and security without managing infrastructure.
- **Local Deployment using Docker**: Run Hasura on any infrastructure or development machine via Docker for full control over the environment.

### Database: PostgreSQL

**PostgreSQL**, or "Postgres", is a robust, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability and performance. Hasura leverages PostgreSQL’s advanced features like triggers and functions seamlessly.

### Frontend: React, Apollo Client

Familiar with **React** through Next.js, exploring **Apollo Client** introduces new aspects:

- **Apollo Client**: This state management library manages both local and remote data with GraphQL, enhancing UI interactions through automatic updates.
  - **Apollo Client Setup**: Wrap the React app with an `ApolloProvider` linked to an Apollo client instance to enable access to GraphQL operations in React components.
  - **Use Queries and Mutations**: Utilize `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks from Apollo for GraphQL interactions.

### What to Focus On

1. **Understanding GraphQL**: Since Hasura hinges on a GraphQL API, it’s crucial to grasp how GraphQL operates, including queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
2. **Mastering Apollo Client**: Explore advanced features like caching, error handling, and data fetching strategies to strengthen the frontend.
3. **Configuring Tailwind**: Learn to adjust `tailwind.config.js` to meet specific design needs.
4. **Securing Data with Hasura**: Dive into Hasura’s security features, particularly its role-based access control, to protect data effectively.

### Learning Resources

- **Hasura Documentation**: Start with the tutorials and guides available at [Hasura Docs](https://hasura.io/docs/).
- **Apollo Documentation**: Access comprehensive tutorials and insights at [Apollo Client Docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/).

This setup should serve as a solid foundation for building efficient, scalable applications using Hasura, Apollo, and React.
